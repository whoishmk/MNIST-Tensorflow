# MNIST-Tensorflow

## In this notebook wwe will carry out the digit recognition on the dataset MNIST that contains the digits 0-9 using a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) composed of two layers. This will be done utilising the Tensorflow , Keras, Pandas and Matplotlib.pyplot library.

## The purpose of this notebook is to load the dataset, preprocess the dataset , building a neural network and then evaluating the performance of the network.
